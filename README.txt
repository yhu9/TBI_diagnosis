Welcome to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Repository!

The study is conducted at University of Alaska Anchorage under the supervision of Dr. Cenek

It is our hope to diagnose Mild, Medium, Severe cases of TBI using 3-d images of the brain fed into a convolutionary neural network. The convolutionary neural network is built using the Tensorflow python library with GPU support in order to make this as fast as possible.

Currently the training set is zero! Yup, we have no training set yet, but instead making the architecture necessary to feed in the data when we get it.

Feel free to look around.
